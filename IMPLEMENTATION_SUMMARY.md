## üîÑ Setup Required

### 1. Database Migration
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Copy the content from: supabase/migrations/20250909_invitations.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
Update your `.env` file with:
```env
# EmailJS Configuration
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_actual_service_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_actual_template_id  
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_actual_public_key

# Stripe Keys (ROTATE THE EXPOSED TEST KEYS!)
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_NEW_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_NEW_SECRET_KEY
```

### 3. EmailJS Template Setup
Create an EmailJS template with these variables:
- `{{to_email}}` - Recipient email
- `{{to_name}}` - Recipient name
- `{{workspace_name}}` - Workspace name
- `{{role}}` - Assigned role
- `{{inviter_name}}` - Person sending invite
- `{{accept_url}}` - Invitation acceptance link
- `{{expires_in}}` - Expiration timeframe

### 4. Stripe Backend API
You'll need to create backend endpoints:
- `POST /api/create-checkout-session`
- `POST /api/create-portal-session`

## üéØ How To Use New Features

### Inviting Users
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Team Management
2. Click "Invite Team Member"
3. Enter email and select role
4. User receives email with acceptance link
5. When they click the link (after logging in), they're added to workspace with assigned role

### Billing Management
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Billing
2. Click "Manage Billing" 
3. Select subscription plan
4. Complete Stripe checkout

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes
1. **IMMEDIATELY** rotate the Stripe test keys that were exposed
2. Never commit real API keys to code - use environment variables only
3. The invitation tokens are secure (UUID + timestamp)
4. Invitations expire after 7 days automatically

## üêõ Known Issues To Monitor
- Gantt drag functionality may still need refinement (previous issue)
- Billing requires backend API implementation
- EmailJS requires service setup and template creation

## üìã Next Steps
1. Set up EmailJS service and templates
2. Implement Stripe backend endpoints
3. Apply database migration
4. Rotate exposed Stripe keys
5. Test invitation flow end-to-end
